This is a completed challenge from the
Django - Models lesson learned on Code Institute course.

1. At first using python shell and
'python manage.py migrate' and
'python manage.py makemigration'
commands you create a Schema in sqlite file and add data to it.
That was the 'inital commit'


2.Then using Django Admin tools I have added more users.
 Then the model was edited and data manipulated.
 I have also created a template and used Bootstrap cdn.
